00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
 Imagine that you are walking in a car on the road in the evening and suddenly another car comes in front of you.

00:06.600 --> 00:13.320
 You think that your car will crash, so you quickly turn the steering wheel and your car gets out of control.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.480
 What should be done in such a situation?

00:15.480 --> 00:17.720
 First of all, do not panic.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.880
 Stay calm and keep your mind cool.

00:19.880 --> 00:25.380
 Because the more calm you are, the easier you will be able to deal with the situation.

00:25.380 --> 00:33.760
 The thing to keep in mind is that in a car crash situation, you get injured only when your car decelerates suddenly.

00:33.760 --> 00:40.560
 If you run into something, so to avoid this, press your brakes as soon as possible and keep the brakes pressed.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.800
 It is important to control the steering wheel as well because if the car has more speed and you turn the steering wheel quickly, the car can turn.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.560
 Do not turn the steering wheel more than necessary.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.120
 Try to take the car if there is grass or a field nearby.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.600
 In a car crash, the airbag often comes out for your safety.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.000
 Ensure that there is an airbag in your car and it is not off.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.120
 Secondly, sufficient space is required for the airbag to come out.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.000
 So sit in the back of your seat.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.540
 If you keep your face closer to the steering wheel, then the danger is more.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.800
 There will be no space for the airbag and then it will be very dangerous.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.500
 After the third crash, see how many injuries you have suffered.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.640
 If you are seriously injured, then do not try to move.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.340
 Wait for an emergency.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.840
 Call and get an emergency.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.500
 And if there is no serious injury or if there is no major car accident, then take the car to a safe place.

01:28.500 --> 01:58.460
 Turn off the ignition and remove the key so that the risk of a fire is lessened.
