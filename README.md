# Deep Learning Project: Voice Translation

This project aims to utilize existing speech translation models to create a application that can do translation, ideally in real time. The following models and platforms are currently being investigated by the group as we work through the semester.

# OpenAI Whisper

One of the models we are investigating is OpenAI's [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/). In brief, Whisper is an automatic speech recognition system developed by OpenAI that has been trained on 680k hours of multilingual speech. It uses an encoder-decoder Transformer, with samples chunked into 30-second segments.

# ESPNet

Another model we are investigating is [ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet), a speech processing toolkit. 

# PaddleSpeech

[PaddleSpeech](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpeech) is another model that we are investigating, that runs on the PaddlePaddle platform. The package was developed by researchers at Baidu, and is designed to facilitate further research and development in speech translation.
